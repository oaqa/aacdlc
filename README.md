Augmented and Alternative Communication Data Logging Consortium

Welcome to the AAC Data Logging Consortium!  We want to thank you for joining us in our efforts to share best standards, practices and open-source software related to log file management for AAC systems.  This consortium has been organized as an open collaboration by Eric Nyberg (<ehn@cs.cmu.edu>), Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, and Katya Hill (<khill@pitt.edu>), University of Pittsburgh and AAC Institute.
